Well, 2023 has at least shown progress in that area and 2022 it was right on the money. In short, if you’re in the bottom right quadrant, you’re golden. Meaning you’re getting a lot of yards and not allowing much from your opponent.\n2022 meant that Maryland was about average for the amount of yardage it gained on offense and it kept opposing teams at bay.\n\n\nCode\n#grouping by years\nyears_md &lt;-  winlosslogs %&gt;% \n  filter(Team == \"Maryland\") %&gt;% \n  group_by(Season) %&gt;% \nsummarise(\n    TotalPlays = sum(OffensivePlays), \n    TotalYards = sum(OffensiveYards), \n    DefensivePlays = sum(DefPlays), \n    DefensiveYards = sum(DefYards), \n    TotalWins = sum(wins)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(\n    OffensiveYPP = TotalYards/TotalPlays, \n    DefensiveYPP = DefensiveYards/DefensivePlays)\n\n\nFrom the data, we need to only show Maryland and its yards per play.\n\n\nCode\n#Graph\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=years_md, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), \n    color=\"red\") + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = 5.700174) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 5.55143) + \n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=years_md, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, label=Season)\n  ) +\n  labs(title=\"Offense is going right for Maryland\", subtitle=\"Through seven games in 2023, Maryland is on the right track.\", caption=\"Source: NCAA | By Dylan Manfre\")  + theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nThrough seven games in 2023, Maryland is averageing a little over six yards per play on offense and so far it’s netted the program five wins. Though, some may say it should be six after a loss to Illinois on homecoming.\nIn the era of Mike Locksley - since 2019 - Maryland has been a bit all over the place. That 2019 season, Maryland allowed quite a bit of yardage. It was the msot out of the available data. The Terps can push that forward if they continue playing to their strengths annd not giving up yards to their opponents."

At the time, maybe not, but over the last four years, Maryland has called a rushing play on third and six three times against Illinois.\nThat’s tied for the most against a single opponent with fellow Big Ten foe Ohio State. Maryland ran the ball six times on third and six last season and they all came outside of the first quarter.\nHowever, of the times Maryland found itself in this situation, two instances were in crunch time with under four minutes remaining in the game. The most recent was in 2022 against NC State, a game Maryland won 16-12. The play came with 42 seconds left on the clock.\nFor Maryland, these situations happen from time to time but to put this in context, third and six rushes happened a total of 24 times in the Big Ten from 2019 to this season in crunch time.\n\n\nCode\n#graph showing how much third and six rushes have happened per season.\n#line chart with y axis as years and x axis as number of times it's happened.\n#Can also highlight Maryland in this\n\nb10_rush_third_six &lt;- b10_rush_third_six %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(season))\n\nb10_years &lt;- b10_rush_third_six %&gt;% \n  group_by(season) %&gt;% \n  summarize(count = n()) %&gt;% \n  arrange(desc(count))\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(\n    data=b10_years, \n    aes(x=reorder(season, -`count`),\n        weight=`count`)) + \n  labs(\n    title=\"Rushing on 3rd and 6 not too uncommon in the Big Ten\", \n    x=\"Year\", \n    y=\"Number of plays\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  coord_flip()"
