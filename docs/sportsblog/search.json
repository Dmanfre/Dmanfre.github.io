At the time, maybe not, but over the last four years, Maryland has called a rushing play on third and six three times against Illinois.\nThat’s tied for the most against a single opponent with fellow Big Ten foe Ohio State. Maryland ran the ball six times on third and six last season and they all came outside of the first quarter.\nHowever, of the times Maryland found itself in this situation, two instances were in crunch time with under four minutes remaining in the game. The most recent was in 2022 against NC State, a game Maryland won 16-12. The play came with 42 seconds left on the clock.\nFor Maryland, these situations happen from time to time but to put this in context, third and six rushes happened a total of 24 times in the Big Ten from 2019 to this season in crunch time.\n\n\nCode\n#graph showing how much third and six rushes have happened per season.\n#line chart with y axis as years and x axis as number of times it's happened.\n#Can also highlight Maryland in this\n\nb10_rush_third_six &lt;- b10_rush_third_six %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(season))\n\nb10_years &lt;- b10_rush_third_six %&gt;% \n  group_by(season) %&gt;% \n  summarize(count = n()) %&gt;% \n  arrange(desc(count))\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(\n    data=b10_years, \n    aes(x=reorder(season, -`count`),\n        weight=`count`)) + \n  labs(\n    title=\"Rushing on 3rd and 6 not too uncommon in the Big Ten\", \n    x=\"Year\", \n    y=\"Number of plays\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  coord_flip()"
